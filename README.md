# Project One

This is the first project for this ROS training course. It aims to create a simulated differential drive robot base mounted with a manipulator. 
In this project, you will learn:

1. How to create a robot platform with URDF and XACRO to be simulated in Gazebo simulator
2. How to interface ROS and Gazebo by using Gazebo ROS plugins
3. How to use MoveIt! to control the robot arm
4. Consolidate your knowledge by playing with the robot base by, e.g., publishing a Twist topic in command line.
